# Code review

Use standalone Code Review when you already have changes to assess in an agent's Git workspace. It supports structured findings, your selection of fixes, and repeated review rounds. A [Mission](./missions#review-and-remediate) has a separate Review stage for its approved feature workflow.

## Before you start

Open the agent working in the checkout you want reviewed. Connect the provider that will do the review, and finish or pause other writers in that folder so the selected change remains stable. An independent reviewer uses the same checkout as the implementation agent; it does not create a worktree.

There must be something to review: staged, unstaged, or untracked changes, or a branch with changes against its base. Inspect the current folder and branch if the expected diff is missing.

## Start a review

1. Enter `/review` in the agent's composer to open Code Review.
2. Choose **Uncommitted changes** for the working diff, or **Current branch** for changes against the base shown in the panel, including uncommitted changes. Unavailable scopes are disabled. A clean checkout with no branch changes shows **Nothing to review**.
3. Choose **Independent reviewer** for a separate Review agent and fresh conversation, or **Current thread** to use the current agent's existing conversation. Current thread requires an existing provider session.
4. When using an independent reviewer, choose its connected provider. It can differ from the implementation agent's provider. Current thread uses the existing agent's provider.
5. Choose a **Review model** and, when the model supports it, **Review effort**. Default keeps the existing reviewer defaults. Korus remembers the last-used provider, model and effort, including separate selections for each provider.
6. Click **Start review** and wait for the round to finish. Follow the separate Review agent when using independent mode.

Choose the scope deliberately. If the feature is committed on a branch, reviewing only uncommitted changes will miss those commits. Check the displayed base for a branch review before starting.

## Automatic remediation

Enable **Automatic remediation** to let an independent reviewer find, fix, and check issues over several rounds. In **Configure**, choose which priorities to fix and the maximum number of rounds. The defaults are P0–P2 and three rounds, including the final verification review.

Fixes stay uncommitted unless you enable **Commit after each fix round**. That option includes existing uncommitted changes in the reviewed workspace, not just the reviewer's fixes. Check the full diff before enabling it. Automatic review never pushes or merges.

Each round uses a fresh review conversation. When no findings remain at the selected priorities, Korus closes the temporary reviewer and sends the result to your original conversation, including any lower-priority findings left open.

Avoid editing the reviewed files while it runs. Failed checks, repeated findings, conflicting workspace changes, or reaching the round limit pause the review and return a partial report. Inspect that report and the diff before continuing manually.

Use **Stop automatic review** to interrupt the reviewer. Stopping does not undo edits or local commits. An interrupted review stays paused after restarting Korus.

### Start from chat

You can explicitly ask your agent to **run an automatic review of my uncommitted
changes**, or of the current branch against a specified base. The agent starts
an independent reviewer with the calling thread's provider, model, and effort
unless you request overrides. It reuses your saved priority and round limits,
but local commits stay off unless you explicitly request them—even if the panel
previously had commits enabled.

The result returns to the same conversation. Ask specifically for an automatic review when you want fixes applied as well as findings reported.

## Inspect the findings

Findings are ordered by priority, from P0 through P3. Read the reported impact and open the affected file where a location is available. Ask for clarification through the finding's discussion action before deciding whether to fix it.

All findings are initially included for remediation. Deselect any you do not want changed. These selections are your approval boundary: starting a review gathers findings; choosing remediation authorizes the selected fixes.

A review is evidence about the selected scope. It does not replace the tests, typechecks, or runtime checks needed for the feature. A round with no findings does not prove there are no defects.

## Remediate

Click **Remediate selected findings** to queue fixes for the included findings. The reviewer applies the changes in the reviewed checkout. Follow the pending, fixing, and fixed states, then inspect the resulting diff and recorded verification evidence.

If no findings are selected, choose **Complete review round**. Unselected findings are recorded as skipped. Remediation changes the files; it is separate from a later commit, merge, push, or deployment.

## Review again

Once the round and any selected fixes are complete, choose **Review again** for another pass over the same scope, or **Finish review** when you accept the result. The round tabs let you compare earlier findings and decisions while the session is active.

An independent reviewer starts a fresh review conversation for the next round. Finishing removes the temporary Review agent and sends a handoff to the original agent describing the remediated findings. Finishing a current-thread review clears its active review panel while leaving the agent's conversation available.

The completion message includes the saved report's location. Use it to revisit the findings, your decisions, fixes, and verification results. If the report cannot be saved, the reviewer stays open so you can resolve the error.

Review state is saved while the session is active. If a round fails, read its error, resolve the provider or workspace problem, and use **Retry review** when offered. An existing active review must finish or stop before another starts for the same target. After interrupted work resumes, check the findings and actual files before authorizing more changes.

See [Workspace & diffs](../features/workspace) for inspecting the changes beside the conversation.
