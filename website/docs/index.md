# Korus documentation

<p class="docs-lead">Set up your coding agents, coordinate the work, and review the results in one workspace.</p>

Korus is a desktop workspace for agentic software engineering. Keep conversations, repositories, browser previews, plans, and diffs together as you move from an idea to delivery.

## Start with one task

Choose a repository and a small outcome. Ask an agent to inspect the relevant code, agree on the change, and run the appropriate checks. Review the full diff before committing.

Follow the [quickstart](./getting-started/quickstart) or the longer [first-task walkthrough](./getting-started/first-task).

## Build a team

Give each agent a clear responsibility and a working folder. Agents can share status and send messages through Korus's collaboration tools. Separate worktrees let multiple agents change the same repository independently.

Read [core concepts](./getting-started/core-concepts), [parallel agents](./workflows/parallel-agents), and [worktrees](./workflows/worktrees).

## Go from idea to delivery

Use a [Mission](./workflows/missions) to move through Requirements, Tickets, Implementation, Review, and Ship. Use [Code Review](./workflows/code-review) when you already have changes to assess, or [Visualize](./features/visualize) to explore a design in the conversation.

## Choose your engine

Korus provides the workspace around your coding agent. Your selected provider supplies model access, account authentication, and usage limits. See the [provider guides](./providers/) for setup.

For issue-driven work, connect [GitHub or Linear](./providers/#connect-github-or-linear), [browse the backlog](./features/workspace#browse-and-start-backlog-work), and choose the code repository where the agent should work.

Use [Automations](./features/automations) to schedule recurring prompts in an agent or Quick Chat.
