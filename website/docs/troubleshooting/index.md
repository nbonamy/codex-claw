# Troubleshooting

Start with the action that failed and the error it produced. Preserve unfinished work before changing the setup or restarting a process.

## The app will not launch

Confirm you installed the intended macOS Apple silicon release and moved it to Applications. Record the app version and any macOS error shown during launch.

Development builds have additional runtime and SDK requirements described in the repository README.

## A provider will not connect

1. Open **Settings → Codex** or **Settings → Claude Code** for the failing engine.
2. Check the selected setup location. A successful login in your normal command-line environment does not authenticate a separate Claw setup.
3. Complete the authentication flow for that selected location. A detected engine and a connected account are separate states.
4. Confirm the engine is enabled. The initial **Continue** button needs at least one installed, connected, enabled engine.

See the [Codex](../providers/codex) or [Claude Code](../providers/claude-code) guide. Include the selected provider and any custom runtime or provider home when reporting the error.

## My previous conversations are missing after changing setup

Check whether you changed **Location** between **Separate Claw chats** and **Use existing setup**. Those environments have different provider history and authentication. The location-switch flow can remove the affected local Claw agents and Quick Chats after you acknowledge it; it does not migrate their history into the new location.

Read the [provider setup overview](../providers/) before making another change. Preserve any repository edits independently of the conversation history.

## GitHub works in another app but not in Claw

Provider authentication and Claw's GitHub integration are separate connections. Open **Settings → Integrations** and complete Claw's GitHub authorization. Check that the authorized account can access the intended repository.

If you skipped GitHub during onboarding, local folder tasks still work. Connect GitHub when you need repository browsing, issue and pull-request intake, or Automations.

## A task is waiting

Inspect the active conversation for a question, approval, queued instruction, or provider error. A waiting task may need a response before work can continue.

If it is actively running, steer or interrupt through the conversation controls as appropriate.

If a Mission is waiting for review, open the selected stage artifact and either provide feedback or accept the proposal. If standalone Code Review has findings, use its review/remediation flow rather than expecting a conversation message to finish the review automatically.

## A worktree or merge fails

Check the repository's status, branch, and existing worktrees. Keep dirty or unfinished work intact. Inspect the reported Git error and resolve the specific conflict before trying integration again.

## A browser preview is blank

Confirm the development server is running and the URL uses the correct port. Inspect the browser console and ask the agent to verify the route that failed. A successful build alone does not prove a page rendered.

The in-app Browser is separate from your Chrome browser and its existing tabs. Follow [Browser](../features/browser) when the task specifically needs Chrome or an existing browser login.

## Computer Use cannot act

Enable the capability in **Settings → Plugins**, then check **Settings → General → System permissions** for the required macOS access. Record whether discovery, a window observation, an interaction, or capture failed.

## Work stops when the app closes

Check **Settings → General → Keep Codex Claw ready in the background** and its reported daemon status. Distinguish closing the desktop window from intentionally stopping the background service.

When you return, inspect the conversation for an approval, question, or provider error before submitting the same instruction again. Preventing sleep while agents run is a separate General setting.

## Report a problem

Include the app version, platform, provider, steps to reproduce, expected result, actual result, and exact error. Use a small reproduction and remove private account details, credentials, and repository content from shared logs or screenshots.
