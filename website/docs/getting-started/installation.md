description: Download and install the Korus desktop app.

# Installation

[Choose your platform](__PRODUCT_DOWNLOAD_URL__): **macOS Apple silicon**, **Windows x64**, or **Linux x64 / ARM64**. Computer Use and AppShots are macOS-only.

## Install on macOS

1. Open [Downloads](__PRODUCT_DOWNLOAD_URL__) and choose the macOS DMG for Apple silicon.
2. Open the DMG and double-click Korus. It installs in Applications and launches. If an installed copy needs replacing, confirm **Replace**; your chats and settings are kept.
3. If Korus asks you to use Finder, choose **Open Applications**, drag Korus there from the DMG, and approve the installation in Finder. Then open Korus from Applications.
4. The first-run screen checks your coding engines. **Install** opens instructions for missing runtimes; the refresh icon rechecks detection. Detected engines offer **Connect** and **Customize**.
5. Choose how each engine should store its setup before connecting it. Follow the steps below, then open a repository.

## Install on Windows

Choose the **Windows x64 installer** from [Downloads](__PRODUCT_DOWNLOAD_URL__), run it, and launch Korus. The Windows build is unsigned, so Windows may display a security warning. Verify that the file came from the official GitHub release before proceeding. A ZIP is also provided for manual extraction.

## Install on Linux

Choose **x64** or **ARM64** to match your system, then select the **DEB**, **RPM**, or **ZIP** format from [Downloads](__PRODUCT_DOWNLOAD_URL__). Use your distribution's package manager for DEB or RPM files; extract the ZIP for a manual installation. Korus does not infer Linux architecture from your browser.

## Updates

Packaged macOS and installed Windows apps receive stable releases through the app's updater. Linux, portable Windows, and prereleases use manual downloads from GitHub Releases. Choose the build for your platform and architecture.

## Choose separate or existing provider setup

Korus can keep its provider setup separate from your existing command-line tools. On the first-run screen, click **Customize** beneath the engine you want to configure.

| Choice | Use it when |
| --- | --- |
| **Separate Korus chats** | You want Korus's chats and provider sign-in kept in a separate setup environment. |
| **Use existing setup** | You want Korus to use the provider environment already configured on this computer. |

This choice is independent for each engine. Selecting an existing setup or signing in to one engine does not configure or authenticate the others.

Follow the [provider setup overview](../providers/) before changing an existing setup. It explains skills and plugin sharing, the selected provider location, and what happens to Korus conversations when you switch locations later.

## Connect at least one engine

Korus does not include a separate model subscription. Connect a provider account with access to the engine you want to use.

1. Select **Connect** for your chosen engine and complete its provider-specific authentication steps.
2. Confirm the engine is connected and enabled. The first-run **Continue** action becomes available when at least one installed engine is connected and enabled; additional engines are optional.
3. Select **Continue**.

Use the [provider guides](../providers/), including [Antigravity setup](../providers/#antigravity), for the engine you choose. A detected installation alone does not establish that its selected setup environment is signed in.

## Connect GitHub, or skip it

The next onboarding step offers GitHub authorization. Connect it if you want to browse GitHub repositories and use issue or pull-request workflows. Choose **Skip for now** to start with a local folder; you can connect GitHub later in **Settings → Integrations**.

GitHub authorization is separate from your coding provider's account. You can run a local repository task without connecting GitHub.

## Open a working folder

In the empty workspace, choose **Existing folder or repository…** to open a checkout already on disk. The same start-work menu offers a new project, a GitHub repository, or a repository URL.

For a first task, choose a small local repository whose branch and existing changes you understand. Continue with the [quickstart](./quickstart).

## Development builds

For source installation and development instructions, see the [repository README](https://github.com/nbonamy/korus#readme).

Experimental source builds may expose behavior that differs from the desktop release. When reporting a problem, include the app version and whether you are using a release or a development build.

## Next step

Follow the [quickstart](./quickstart). If launch or authentication fails, start with [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/).
