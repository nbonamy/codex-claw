description: Install Korus, connect a provider, and complete a small repository task.
---

# Quickstart

Start with one repository, one agent, and a small change you can review.

## Install Korus

[Download Korus](__PRODUCT_DOWNLOAD_URL__) for your platform and launch it. See [Installation](./installation) for macOS Apple silicon, Windows x64, and Linux x64 / ARM64 instructions.

## Choose your provider's setup

On the first-run screen, select **Customize** beneath Codex or Claude Code. Choose **Separate Korus chats** for its own setup environment, or **Use existing setup** to reuse the provider environment already on your computer. Configure each engine separately.

Use **Connect Codex** or **Connect Claude Code** and complete that engine's authentication steps. Once at least one engine is connected and enabled, select **Continue**. You can manage these choices later in **Settings → Codex** or **Settings → Claude Code**.

The [Codex guide](../providers/codex) and [Claude Code guide](../providers/claude-code) explain the separate setup and sign-in flows. Model access and usage limits come from the provider account you connect.

At the GitHub step, connect your account if you want GitHub workflows, or select **Skip for now** for a local repository task.

## Open your repository

Choose **Existing folder or repository…** from the empty workspace's start-work menu and select your local checkout. You can also open a GitHub repository or clone a repository URL from that menu.

If multiple engines are enabled, select the engine for the new conversation. Keep the default checkout for a small first task. To add another conversation for an open repository, use its **New session** plus button in the sidebar and choose the checkout or branch you want.

For a first task, use a repository whose current changes you understand. If other agents will also write to it, use [separate worktrees](../workflows/worktrees).

## Ask for a bounded change

For example:

```text
Inspect the settings screen and explain how it saves preferences.
Then add a helpful empty state where no preferences are available.
Follow the repository instructions and run the relevant checks.
```

Follow the conversation as the agent inspects files, proposes work, and runs commands. Respond when it asks for input or an approval.

## Review the result

Open the Git changes and inspect the full diff. Check what was validated and what remains unverified. Ask for corrections, or use [Code Review](../workflows/code-review) for an independent pass.

Before delivery, confirm these four things:

- The agent worked in the intended folder and branch.
- The complete diff contains only the change you requested.
- The reported checks exercised the behavior you changed.
- Any unfinished work or unverified behavior is stated clearly.

When the result is ready, ask for the commit or delivery action you want. A completed turn does not imply a commit, push, or deployment. Continue with [Your first task](./first-task) for a fuller walkthrough.
