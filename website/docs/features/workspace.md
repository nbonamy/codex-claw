# Workspace & diffs

The workspace beside the conversation keeps the artifacts you need for decisions within reach.

Use its **+** menu to open **Files**, **Changes**, **Review**, **Visualize**, **Simulator**, or **Browser** where supported. Tabs can be closed with their close button; right-click a tab for its tab actions.

## Documents and plans

Ask the agent to display Markdown in the side panel when a guide, report, or proposal should remain visible:

```text
Show the implementation proposal in the side panel so we can discuss each step.
```

Plans and displayed documents have their own tabs. Keep the artifact open while discussing revisions so feedback refers to a concrete result.

## Files and diffs

Open **Files** to browse the agent's folder, expand directories, or search by path. Select a file to preview it. On macOS, **⌘P** opens the quick file picker; type part of the path and select the result.

When available, **Open In** opens the selected project file in a detected editor or application. The file preview is for inspection; ask the agent to change a file or open it in your editor when you want to edit it yourself.

Clicking a file link in chat downloads the file when it is binary or too large to preview. Previewable text and images still open in the workspace. This fallback applies to chat file links; a missing or unreadable file still reports an error.

Open **Changes** or press **⌘G** to inspect Git diffs. The agent header's diff selector lets you choose the scope:

| Scope | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| Uncommitted | The current repository changes; this is the initial selection. |
| Staged / Unstaged | The corresponding Git changes. |
| Last turn | The recorded diff for the latest turn, when available. |
| Branch | Changes against the available base reference. |
| Commits | A selected commit from the available catalog. |

The **Changes** pane's refresh action reloads the selected diff. Its **…** menu controls staged, unstaged, and untracked sections when available, word wrap, and expanding or collapsing files. Select a file in the diff to open its preview.

Use the full repository diff before delivery so earlier or unrelated edits are accounted for.

## Mobile simulators

Run an iOS simulator or Android emulator beside your conversation. Interact with the live screen yourself, or ask your Codex or Claude agent to inspect the app, tap, swipe, type, and capture screenshots while you work on the code.

### Set up a device

Use the Korus desktop app with a local agent. Install the tools for your platform first:

- **iOS:** Xcode and an iOS simulator runtime on your Mac.
- **Android:** Android SDK Platform Tools and Emulator, with a configured virtual device.

Open **+ → Simulator** in the workspace, choose the platform when offered, and select a device. Korus boots it if needed and shows its live screen. The pane offers setup guidance if required tools are missing.

### Try the app together

Use the live screen to tap, swipe, and type. The pane also has controls for rotation, Home, Android Back, and copying a screenshot.

You can ask the agent to open a simulator and check a specific flow:

```text
Open the Android emulator and check the sign-in flow in our app.
Try an invalid password, then sign in. Take screenshots of anything
that needs fixing.
```

Each device is attached to one agent at a time. **Detach** releases it for another agent and leaves it running; **Power off** shuts it down. Neither erases its data.

Simulator access is for local virtual devices, not physical phones or remote teams.

## Browse and start backlog work

Connect [GitHub or Linear](../providers/#connect-github-or-linear) in Settings first. Open **Backlog** from the left rail to browse work across sources, or use the repository's **Backlog** pane or **Create from…** issue picker for work in that repository.

Choose **GitHub** or **Linear** when both are connected, then a repository or Linear **Team / project**. A repository's GitHub backlog stays scoped to that repository. Selecting a Linear source changes the issues shown while keeping the code repository context. Linear issues display their identifier, such as `ENG-42`, and their native workflow status; pull-request choices apply only to GitHub.

In a repository backlog, search by issue identifier or title and use the state, assignee, and label filters to narrow the list. Open an item to read its details before assigning work. For an issue:

1. Choose **New agent** for a new agent and worktree, or **Existing agent** when offered. An existing agent keeps working on its current branch; Korus never creates or switches a branch or worktree for it.
2. For a new agent, choose the coding engine, model, and reasoning effort, and check the branch it will be created on.
3. Select **Investigate**, **Fix**, or **Custom** to prepare your own prompt.

For a pull request, **Existing agent** is offered only for agents already on the pull request's branch, so reviews and feedback always run against the right code.

From the global Backlog, select items and start work, choose the destination **Team** and coding engine, and choose a **Code repository** for Linear. Each selected item starts a separate agent in a worktree. Korus does not infer a local clone from the Linear team or project name.

Assigned items link back to their agent. Korus's assignment and completion status tracks the agent's work; it does not by itself change an issue's status in Linear or GitHub, merge a pull request, or deploy code. Ask explicitly when you want an external issue updated.

## Commit and deliver

The agent header's Git action menu offers actions supported by the current branch and repository, including **Commit**, **Push**, **Merge**, and **Create PR**.

In **Commit**, review the message and change scope before choosing **Commit** or **Commit and push**. Staged changes are included. **Include unstaged changes** is on by default; **Include untracked files** is off by default. Turn off unstaged inclusion if you have deliberately staged only part of the work.

**Push** sends existing commits to the displayed destination. Uncommitted changes remain local. A remote and branch must be available; the push action becomes available when there are commits ahead to send.

Linked worktrees can also offer an update from their base branch. See [Worktrees](../workflows/worktrees) for merge and cleanup, and [Code Review](../workflows/code-review) for the separate structured review workflow. **Changes** is the diff viewer; **Review** runs the review workflow.

## Agent workspace state

Workspace tabs stay associated with their agent. Switching agents changes the context without combining their documents or browser work.

In a split conversation layout, the artifact sidebar follows the focused agent.

## Review before delivery

Check the files changed, the intended scope, and the validation evidence. Ask for a [Code Review](../workflows/code-review) when you want another pass.
