# Testing

Focused tests while iterating; the relevant full gate before handoff or commit.

"Contract" and "workflow" tests here mean Electron IPC, the Korus WebSocket
adapter, client state, renderer behavior, or a fake backend transport (Korus is a
desktop app: no server/API integration gates). Fakes sit at ownership boundaries:

| Under test | Fake |
| --- | --- |
| App controller / state routing | unified backend fake |
| Real Codex driver | typed Codex SDK surface (never the real SDK against a fake app-server; that boundary belongs to the SDK repo) |
| Real Claude driver | fake Claude SDK query |
| Mounted UI / `App` | `vue/src/test/client-api-mock.ts` + `backend-fixture.ts` |

Korus tests its adapter translations and product behavior, not either SDK. Wire
framing, decoding and lifecycle tests for its own process/socket transports remain.
Real provider smoke tests are opt-in and never part of the normal gate.

## Quality Bar

Every code change adds or updates tests for the behavior it changes; no small-change
exemption. If a test cannot be run or a change is truly untestable or docs-only, say
so explicitly and name what to run next.

All five workspaces (`core`, `backend`, `vue`, `electron`, `web`) gate on exactly
**85% statements**; lines, branches and functions are diagnostics. Never lower the
threshold or shrink includes/exclusions to land a change. Coverage is evidence of
exercised behavior, not a reason to invent a test. Leave no broad untested areas
around IPC, protocol adapters, persistence, reducers, agent status, tool rendering,
approvals, diffs, filesystem, git or teams.

## Principles

- Test behavior, not implementation: assert what users see, what IPC emits, what
  state changes, what contracts return. Prefer workflows over isolated pings, and
  follow a mutation with a read, list, event, persisted snapshot or cleanup check.
- Use `toStrictEqual()` for app-owned contracts and fixtures; do not cherry-pick
  fields with scattered `toHaveProperty()` when the full shape is the contract.
- Isolate and clean up: tests are idempotent, close streams, child processes, file
  handles and subscriptions in `finally`.
- Mock external boundaries, never the logic under test.

## Test Value Gate

Name the regression a test protects in one sentence. Accept it only if:

1. it exercises production behavior through the closest owning public seam;
2. that regression would fail it for the right reason;
3. a harmless refactor, rewording, file move or equivalent implementation keeps it
   green;
4. no closer layer already protects the same contract in more detail.

Otherwise do not add it, and remove an existing test that fails the gate when no
realistic regression risk is lost. A test that survives replacing the implementation
with a constant, or breaks on harmless rewording, fails the gate. Accepted tests
protect a user-visible outcome, an owned or external contract, a state transition or
persistence guarantee, or an error/security/architecture boundary.

- Mount Vue components and assert rendered DOM, accessibility state, interactions,
  emitted events or resulting behavior. When behavior depends on CSS, mount with the
  production styles and assert the resolved result (proving the selector matches and
  the cascade applies); use a real browser only for layout geometry.
- Do not assert every sentence of tool descriptions, prompts or help text. Test
  interpolation, conditional sections, schemas and the behavior they enable; keep one
  assertion where exact copy is itself the contract.
- **Never read production `.vue`, TypeScript, stylesheets, scripts, manifests or
  config as text to assert their contents.** Enforce architecture and security rules
  with lint, TypeScript, AST or dependency tooling. Tests may read source only when it
  is product input, via a fixture, and may inspect generated artifacts that are the
  output under test.
- Give the detailed assertion to the owning unit and keep one representative smoke
  test at the next boundary. Table-driven rows must be distinct behaviors.
- Keep snapshots rare; prefer explicit assertions.

## Main Process And Preload

Without a real backend process by default, cover: RPC parsing, request/response
matching, notifications, malformed responses and client callbacks; app-server
lifecycle (spawn/connect, readiness, restart, shutdown, cleanup); driver routing and
policy (create/resume/archive, submit/steer/interrupt, status projection);
routing-envelope and replica revision handling without a second Korus reducer;
approval and input coordination; persistence, migrations, settings, teams, agents and
window state; filesystem and git at the app boundary. Host-boundary tests prove Korus
forwards SDK snapshots, events and promise-returning actions without duplicating SDK
behavior.

Preload is a security boundary and must stay narrow: test allowed channels and
argument validation, typed returns, subscribe/unsubscribe cleanup, reload snapshot
behavior and renderer-safe errors. Never expose broad Electron or Node primitives.

## Renderer

Vue Test Utils, Vitest and jsdom. Co-locate specs in `__tests__/`, one same-named
spec per component, no catch-all suites. Prefer direct props and emits over booting
the shell; use small store fakes only when the contract depends on a store; stub IPC at
the app boundary, not inside the tree; do not use Codex app-server fixtures for
visual components. Test loading, empty, error, disabled, pending-approval and
streaming states separately. If a component is too hard to isolate, split it first.

- The shared setup supplies lightweight Element Plus controls that preserve rendered
  and emitted contracts (DOM, classes, aria, slots, model events). A placeholder that
  only makes a test mount is not acceptable. Mount the real control when its own
  interaction, validation, focus, teleport or accessibility is under test.
- Avoid product-component stubs unless the child is covered elsewhere. App-shell
  tests use contract-faithful child stubs by default and real children only for
  representative composition workflows.
- SDK-owned behavior (composer, message rendering, clipboard, attachments, paste/drop,
  transcription, approval and ask-user UI) is tested in the SDK; Korus tests only its
  wrapper, adapter and product policy.
- Test capabilities through a visible control and its interaction result, not
  forwarded props. Assert event retention before supplying a later navigation
  snapshot that could repair lost state.

## Fixtures

Scripted, never simulators: `backend/src/codex/__tests__/sdk-surface-fixture.ts`
(typed SDK methods, per-conversation snapshots, explicit events; tests supply the
provider's resulting state, so the fixture must not grow a reducer),
`backend/src/claude/__tests__/sdk-query-fixture.ts` (independently controlled query
iterators; inputs, permissions and failures observable at the SDK boundary), and
`vue/src/test/client-api-mock.ts` (exhaustive typed `AppApi` fake with production
initialization, disposable subscriptions, I/O-free defaults, and throwing
consequential operations unless scripted). Per-test overrides merge into the complete
fake; use `stubLegacyElectronTestWindow` only to test missing-method compatibility,
and await asynchronous initialization before exercising controls.

`sdk-boundary-*.spec.ts`, Claude's `sdk-boundary.spec.ts` and `*backend-boundary.spec.ts`
run in the normal glob and CI (`npm run test:integration` is a fast entry). Keep
lower-level tests for Korus-owned algorithms, provider translation, wire security,
persistence, filesystem and Git safety. A provider-independent service needs no
artificial Codex and Claude variants.

- Store captured fixtures next to their tests; include malformed and partial-stream
  cases and enough original payload shape to catch protocol drift.
- Drive the real adapter from SDK-shaped fixtures and renderer composition from the
  resulting app-owned contract; renderer tests never import generated Codex types.
- When replacing tests, record the retained Korus behavior and its new owning suite;
  delete SDK-owned optimistic-message, raw-reduction and slash-copy assertions rather
  than transplanting them, and never trade failure, identity or ordering tests for
  call-through smoke tests.
- To prove a regression family is caught, inject a temporary deliberate fault (drop a
  review event, remove a queue lock), watch it fail, restore and rerun green. These
  probes are local validation, never committed switches.

## Conversation Ownership

Provider suites own transcript semantics. Korus tests only: targeted operations never
cross agent or conversation identity; one reset plus revisioned deltas yields one row
per provider message; stale or gapped revisions trigger rehydration; Electron
forwards frames without reducing; snapshot persistence and sync stay transcript-free;
projections (plans, diffs, unread, sidebar activity) are read-only and cannot
resurrect or mutate provider turns. Plan review decisions are explicit commands:
test pending-review persistence, identity, idempotence and failed acceptance. Client
isolation tests assert no implicit runtime loading and that snapshot queries do no
maintenance. Use captured long-conversation fixtures for deterministic performance
regressions; do not reintroduce a transcript reducer to benchmark provider traffic.

## Gates

`package.json` scripts are the reference. `npm test`, `npm run test:coverage`,
`npm run lint` (includes every workspace typecheck and the Knip dead-code check) and
`npm run build`. Prefer `npm run test:ai` for agent-driven full runs: same suites,
quiet output, `[TESTS:DONE]` after each workspace. Host-only iteration uses suffixed
commands (`test:electron`, `typecheck:web`, …). For visual changes add a local
app/screenshot check when the app can boot; for protocol or persistence changes run
the touched module's tests plus the full coverage gate.

Before release CI runs `npm run test:coverage` then `npm run test:scripts`
(coverage already executes every workspace suite, and lint already covers
typechecks). A failed test or any workspace below 85% statements blocks release. Run
against the installed SDK package boundary; source aliases do not substitute for
package verification. Desktop smoke (boot, create or select an agent, pick a folder,
send, stream, interrupt or approve, restore after reload) and screenshot checks for
shell, sidebars, composer, artifact panes, diffs and theme switching apply once the
chosen desktop tool is configured.
